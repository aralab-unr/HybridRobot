# Hybrid Steel Bridge Inspection Robot
This repo contains all the functions, libraries which were used in this projects. There are some main functions such as:
(1) Point Cloud Boundary
(2) Area check
(3) Pose Estimation
(4) Plane's Height check
(5) Path Availability in Mobile Transformation 

  To get a stable point cloud data, the data is captured several times, then combine the pointclouds into one. THe processing on the aggregated one is more stable than a single one.

The program works on ROS-Service approach. All functions are in the hybrid_robot.cpp, pcl_server.cpp, mp_server.cpp files, which operates as a server. To trigger services, the program hybrid_robot.cpp, pcl_server.cpp, mp_server.cpp are invoked.
